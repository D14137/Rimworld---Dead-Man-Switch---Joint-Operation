  <AAC_MechCorps.description>The Rogue Legion is what remains after the central command core of the colonial fleet’s unmanned forces was corroded by a mechanoid hive-mind.

Composed entirely of machine units, they operate with a highly coordinated, hive-like doctrine. Their ranks are typically equipped with gunpowder weapons and favor multi-wave assaults that grind down defenses. They show indiscriminate hostility toward any human settlement and systematically dismantle captured technology to strengthen themselves.

Their bases are often established near geothermal anomalies, tapping the heat to sustain vast computational demands.</AAC_MechCorps.description>
