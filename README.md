# Rimworld Dead Man Switch - Joint Operation
A mechanoid/weapon expansion mod focused on restoring the ancient joint operation system of ancient combat mechanoid divisions, requiring Dead Man Switch and Dead Man Switch - Ancient Corps as prerequisites.

CE Compatible

Update for 2026-01-15:

1. Added Combat Extended (CE) compatibility:
   - Added CE compatibility for weapons, mechanoids, materials, and apparel.
   - Made slight adjustments to CE's indirect fire mechanics, allowing this mod's artillery mechanoids to simulate the meter-level precision of modern, informationized artillery (they will not suffer severe accuracy penalties due to lack of direct line of sight or forward observers). [Theoretically, a "guided artillery shell" ammunition type should be added, but this was not implemented to reduce logistical (and coding) complexity.]
   - The rocket launcher has been changed to a reusable weapon requiring RPG-7 ammunition for reloading.
   - Orbital bombardment is now compatible with CE; however, explosions in orbital debris rain remain non-CE explosions due to code limitations—currently they are just large fireworks. A fix will be attempted in the future.
   - Terminal-sensitive munitions are now compatible with CE. CE's shrapnel mechanics for artillery shells significantly increase their area of effect, which made the role of this mod's cluster munitions ambiguous. Therefore, cluster munitions are not included in the CE version.
   - The CE stats for most mechanoids were assigned somewhat arbitrarily and may be slightly rough. Suggestions for adjustments are welcome.
2. Fixed a bug where the Tinker mechanoid could not be resurrected.
3. Added the Mechanoid Relay function to the Quietus Eye mechanoid.
