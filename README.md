# Rimworld Dead Man Switch - Joint Operation
A mechanoid/weapon expansion mod focused on restoring the ancient joint operation system of ancient combat mechanoid divisions, requiring Dead Man Switch and Dead Man Switch - Ancient Corps as prerequisites.

**The CE Patch has been updated.**

**English translation provided by GPT-5.2. I will refined it recently.**

### Introduction:

This mod introduces multiple classes of heavy mechanoids, sufficient to form a comprehensive joint combat system with both offensive and defensive capabilities, including:  
- **[Armor]** Cost-effective frontline mechanoids (reusing the sprites of Shortgunners, Hedges, and Bastions)  
- **[Logistics]** Field repair mechanoids that provide power and health replenishment to conscripted mechanoids  
- **[Command & Control]** Command mechanoids capable of remotely loading maps and providing support skills  
- **[Artillery]** Artillery and rocket artillery mechanoids capable of cross-map strikes, along with additional ammunition types (precision-guided munitions, cluster munitions)  
- **[Shielding]** Shield mechanoids with enhanced high/low-angle protection  

Additionally:  
- A series of large-caliber weapons for heavy mechanoids has been added.  
- A high-strength fabric-like material has been introduced for crafting the mod's frontline mechanoids, which can also be used to make clothing.  
- Two types of line-of-sight-independent orbital targeters (orbital bombardment and orbital junk rain) and their acquisition methods have been added.  
- Recipes for mass-producing mechanoid construction materials have been included.  
- Two pieces of equipment that increase mechanitor bandwidth and bandwidth groups have been added.  
- An early-game, fast-aiming anti-tank rocket launcher has been introduced.  
- A permanently hostile mechanoid faction—the Rogue Legion—has been added, featuring high-intensity raids but no boss-type units.  
- The performance of the original Dead Man's Switch mechanoids, as well as some mechanoids from the Ancient Mechanoid Expansion and Synthetic Humanoid Expansion, has been adjusted to make them more effective.  

### Update for 2026-01-15:

1. Added Combat Extended (CE) compatibility:
   - Added CE compatibility for weapons, mechanoids, materials, and apparel.
   - Made slight adjustments to CE's indirect fire mechanics, allowing this mod's artillery mechanoids to simulate the meter-level precision of modern, informationized artillery (they will not suffer severe accuracy penalties due to lack of direct line of sight or forward observers). [Theoretically, a "guided artillery shell" ammunition type should be added, but this was not implemented to reduce logistical (and coding) complexity.]
   - The rocket launcher has been changed to a reusable weapon requiring RPG-7 ammunition for reloading.
   - Orbital bombardment is now compatible with CE; however, explosions in orbital debris rain remain non-CE explosions due to code limitations—currently they are just large fireworks. A fix will be attempted in the future.
   - Terminal-sensitive munitions are now compatible with CE. CE's shrapnel mechanics for artillery shells significantly increase their area of effect, which made the role of this mod's cluster munitions ambiguous. Therefore, cluster munitions are not included in the CE version.
   - The CE stats for most mechanoids were assigned somewhat arbitrarily and may be slightly rough. Suggestions for adjustments are welcome.
2. Fixed a bug where the Tinker mechanoid could not be resurrected.
3. Added the Mechanoid Relay function to the Quietus Eye mechanoid.
